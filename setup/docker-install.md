# Docker Installation

## Purpose
Docker is used for service isolation (Pi-hole, PiVPN) and easier system management.

## Installation
- Installed docker.io via apt
- Enabled docker service on boot
- Added user to docker group

## Docker Compose
The docker-compose-plugin package was not available via apt on Raspberry Pi OS.
Installed docker-compose instead.

## Notes 
- System restart after installation
